# Normative Requirements (from ETSI TS 119 411-8 V1.1.1)

The following requirements are derived from ETSI TS 119 411-8 v1.1.1. A requirement is considered in scope for the Pilot if it meets any of the following criteria:

- It is required for at least one of the Aptitude use cases;
- It is essential for the Authentication, Authorization, and/or Lifecycle Management processes;
- It does not depend on external entities, such as a Member State or the European Commission, for policy or additional technical specifications.
