| CT_01 | An Access CA issuing access certificates SHALL register these in a CT log according to RFC 9162, if such a log is available for access certificates. | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 55 | Access certificate, CT Log | Registration | Access Certificate Authority | No | In the LSP we hardcode the Signed Certificate Timestamp in the Access Certificate avoiding the testing of the CT Log. |
| CT_02 | An Access CA issuing access certificates SHALL describe in its Certificates Practice Statement (CPS) how it logs all access certificates. | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 55 | Access certificate, CT Log | Registration | Access Certificate Authority | No | CPS is a normative/comformance aspect and therefore not to be tested |
| CT_03 | In case a CT log provider for access certificates is available, all Access CAs SHALL act as monitors in the CT ecosystem. Access CAs SHOULD still monitor the CT logs in situations of temporary unavailability. | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 55 | Access certificate, CT Log | Registration | Access Certificate Authority | No | Monitorning of the CT log cannot be tested in the pilot. |
| CT_04 | An Access CA SHALL include at least one Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT) in each access certificate. | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 55 | Access certificate | Registration, Trust evaluation (Authentication) | Access Certificate Authority | Yes |  |
| CT_05 | When verifying an access certificate during PID or attestation issuance or presentation, a Wallet Unit SHALL also verify that the access certificate includes at least one valid Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT). | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 55 | Access certificate | Trust evaluation (Authentication) | Wallet Provider | Yes |  |
| CT_06 | If an access certificate does not include a valid SCT, a Wallet Unit SHALL handle this as a failure or Relying Party authentication, in compliance with all requirements in [Topic 6] and in particular requirement RPA_06a. | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 55 | Access certificate | Trust evaluation (Authentication) | Wallet Provider | Yes |  |
| ISSU_07 | After a Wallet Unit receives a PID from a PID Provider, it SHALL validate the signature of the PID using a trust anchor of the PID Provider provided in a LoTE made available in accordance with [Topic 31], unless this would result in the validation of the PID signature being done by the same component that created the signature. <br> <br>*Note: This could be the case in architectures where the Wallet Provider is also the PID Provider and the Wallet Units use a remote HSM as their WSCD.* | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 10 | Trusted List, Credential | Trust evaluation (Authentication) | Wallet Provider | Yes |  |
| ISSU_08 | After a Wallet Unit receives a QEAA from a QEAA Provider, it SHALL validate the qualified signature of the QEAA in accordance with Art. 32 of the [European Digital Identity Regulation]. For the verification, the Wallet Unit SHALL use a trust anchor provided in a QEAA Provider Trusted List made available in accordance with Art. 22 of the [European Digital Identity Regulation].<br><br>*Note: a) Requirements ISSU_07 to ISSU_10 are equivalent to requirements OIA_12 to OIA_15 in Topic 1. b) These requirements imply that a Wallet Instance must be aware whether the attestation it is requesting from an issuer is a PID, a QEAA, a PuB-EAA, or a non-qualified EAA. These requirements also imply that the Wallet Unit must store trust anchors in such a way that, when it receives an issued attestation, it is able to distinguish between trust anchors usable either for PIDs, for QEAAs, for PuB-EAAs, or for non-qualified EAAs.* | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 10 | Trusted List, Credential | Trust evaluation (Authentication) | Wallet Provider | Yes |  |
| ISSU_09 | After a Wallet Unit receives a PuB-EAA from a PUB-EAA Provider, it SHALL validate the qualified signature of the PuB-EAA in accordance with Art. 32 of the [European Digital Identity Regulation]. For that verification, the Wallet Unit SHALL use the public key provided in the qualified certificate of the QTSP supporting the qualified signature. The Wallet Unit SHALL also validate the qualified certificate of the QTSP using a trust anchor provided in a Trusted List made available in accordance with Art. 22 of the [European Digital Identity Regulation]. Finally, the Wallet Unit SHALL also verify the certified attributes of the qualified certificate, as specified in Article 45f. | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 10 | Trusted List, Credential | Trust evaluation (Authentication) | Wallet Provider | Yes | if use cases with PuB-EAA are present |
| ISSU_10 | After a Wallet Unit receives a non-qualified EAA from an EAA Provider, it SHALL validate the signature of the EAA if it has access to the trust anchors of the EAA Provider.<br><br>*Note: For a non-qualified EAA, an Attestation Rulebook may be available, see [Topic 12], explaining how EAA Providers distribute their trust anchors. However, it is not required for Wallet Units to be in possession of the trust anchors of all non-qualified EAA Providers, even when an Attestation Rulebook is available.* | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 10 | Trusted List, Credential | Trust evaluation (Authentication) | Wallet Provider | Yes | if use cases with EAA are present |
| ISSU_11 | A Wallet Unit SHALL request the User's approval before storing a PID or attestation obtained from a PID Provider or Attestation Provider.

The Wallet Instance SHALL also inform the User about the identity of the PID Provider or Attestation Provider, using the subject information in the PID Provider's or Attestation Provider's access certificate. | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 10 | Access certificate | Other | Wallet Provider | Yes | if PID issuance is tested within the LSP |
| ISSU_12d | If an Attestation Provider supports revocation chaining for its attestations per WURevocation_19 in Topic 38, the expiration date of an attestation SHALL be no later than the expiration date of the WUA presented as part of the attestation issuance process. <br> <br>*Note: See note in ISSU_12c.* |  | Credential | Other | PuB-EAA Provider, QEAA Provider, EAA Provider, PID Provider | Maybe | Leaning no, revocation of attestation is out of scope for the TM |
| ISSU_19 | For the verification of a WUA or WIA, a PID Provider SHALL accept the trust anchors in the Wallet Provider LoTE(s) it needs. <br> <br>*Note: <br> a) The Wallet Provider LoTE is explained in [Topic 31]. b) It is not mandatory for a PID Provider to accept all Wallet Provider LoTEs, if there are multiple. This is because it is not mandatory for a PID Provider to accept all certified Wallet Solutions in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem. Each PID Provider will choose which LoTEs they need to subscribe to.* | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 10 | Trusted List | Trust evaluation (Authentication) | PID Provider | Yes | if PID issuance is tested within the LSP |
| ISSU_21 | Before issuing a PID, a PID Provider SHALL verify that the Wallet Provider mentioned in the Wallet Unit's WUA and WIA is present in a Wallet Provider LoTE. The PID Provider SHALL also authenticate and validate the WUA and WIA using the trust anchor(s) registered for the Wallet Provider in that LoTE. Moreover, it SHALL verify that the Wallet Units's WUA is not revoked.<br><br>*Note: a) For the WUA, see [Topic 9] and [Topic 38], Article 3 (9), also allows another authentication mechanism in accordance with an electronic identity scheme notified at assurance level high. However, the ARF does not further specify such other authentication mechanisms, which means that in general they will not be interoperable.* | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 10 | Trusted List | Trust evaluation (Authentication) | Trust Evaluation process, Trusted List | Trust evaluation (issuance) | PID Provider |
| ISSU_22 | A PID Provider SHALL sign its Credential Issuer metadata as specified in section 12.2.3 of [OpenID4VCI]. To do so, the PID Provider SHALL use the private key corresponding to the public key in its access certificate. The PID Provider SHALL include its access certificate, as well as all intermediate certificate(s) leading up to the trust anchor of the corresponding Access Certificate Authority (see ISSU_33) in the LoTE, in the ``x5c`` parameter in the JOSE header of the JSON Web Signature for the metadata. | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 10 | Access certificate | Trust evaluation (Authentication) | PID Provider | Yes |  |
| ISSU_23 | For the verification of a PID Provider's access certificates, a Wallet Unit SHALL accept the trust anchors in the LoTE(s) of Access Certificate Authorities it needs.<br><br>*Note: a) Access Certificate Authority LoTEs are explained in [Topic 27].* | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 10 | Access certificate, Trusted List | Trust evaluation (Authentication) | Wallet Provider | Yes |  |
| ISSU_23b | Prior to or during installation of a Wallet Instance, the Wallet Provider SHALL notify the User about the PID Provider(s) that are supported by the Wallet Unit. |  |  | Trust evaluation (Authorization), Other |  | Maybe | To clarify if this is related to policy entitlement management |
| ISSU_24 | A Wallet Unit SHALL authenticate and validate the access certificate of the PID Provider before requesting the issuance of a PID. The Wallet Unit SHALL verify that the access certificate is authentic and is valid at the time of validation, and that the issuer of the access certificate is included in an Access Certificate Authority LoTE. | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 10 | Access certificate, Trusted List | Trust evaluation (Authentication) | Wallet Provider | Yes | Which is the difference with ISSU_23? |
| ISSU_24a | Before requesting the issuance of an attestation, the Wallet Unit SHALL verify that the PID Provider is indeed a registered PID Provider. To do so, the Wallet Unit SHALL a) Inspect the ``entitlement`` member in the registration certificate of the PID Provider, if provided in the Credential Issuer Metadata per ETSI TS 119 472-3 section 4.2.3, and verify the authenticity of the registration certificate. b) If no registration certificate is present, query the responsible Registrar for the registered value of ``entitlement``, using the URI in the Credential Issuer Metadata, if possible. c) If querying the Registrar is not possible, optionally inspect the ``entitlement`` member included in the Credential Issuer Metadata itself per ETSI TS 119 472-3 section 4.2.3. If this procedure does not confirm that the PID Provider is indeed registered as a PID Provider, the Wallet Unit SHALL display a warning to the User, and SHALL NOT request the issuance of a PID.<br><br> *Note: The information in the ``entitlement`` member included in the Credential Issuer Metadata (3rd option above) is self-declared by the PID Provider. It is up to the Wallet Provider to decide to trust this information if the registration certificate is not available and querying the registry is not successful.* | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 10 | Access certificate, Registration Certificate, Registry | Trust evaluation (Authorization) | Wallet Provider | Yes | it seems missing the of the Provider of RC TL |

| ISSU_29 | A QEAA Provider or PuB-EAA Provider SHALL support all Wallet Solutions, except in case the attestation in question is a Strong User Authentication (SUA) attestation as meant in Topic 20 and the Wallet Provider does not support processing of the transactional data associated with the SUA attestation. Except for such cases, A QEAA Provider or PuB-EAA Provider SHALL NOT discriminate between Wallet Solutions when processing a request for the issuance of an attestation. <br> <br>*Note: This requirement is not applicable for non-qualified EAA Providers. For example, a non-qualified EAA Provider may choose to issue attestations in the format specified in [W3C VCDM], see ARB_01a. In that case, it will support only those Wallet Solutions that have implemented this attestation format.* | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 10 | Credential | Other, Trust evaluation (Authorization) | QEAA Provider, PuB-EAA Provider | Maybe | Dependent on SUA being piloted. Need support from other use cases. |

Except for such cases, Wallet Units SHALL be capable of requesting the issuance of a QEAA, PuB-EAA, or non-qualified EAA from all Attestation Providers at the User's request. |  | Credential | Other, Trust evaluation (Authorization) | Wallet Provider | Maybe | Dependent on SUA being piloted. Need support from other use cases. |
| ISSU_34 | A Wallet Unit SHALL authenticate and validate the access certificate of the Attestation Provider before requesting the issuance of an attestation. The Wallet Unit SHALL verify that the access certificate is authentic and is valid at the time of validation, and that the issuer of the access certificate is in the Access Certificate Authority LoTE(s), as documented in [Topic 27]. | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 10 | Access certificate, Trusted List | Trust evaluation (Authentication) | Wallet Provider | Yes | Equivalent to ISSU_24 |
| ISSU_34a | Before requesting the issuance of an attestation, the Wallet Unit SHALL verify that the Attestation Provider is a registered QEAA Provider, PuB-EAA Provider, or EAA Provider. To do so, the Wallet Unit SHALL a) Inspect the ``entitlement`` member in the registration certificate of the Attestation Provider, if provided in the Credential Issuer Metadata per ETSI TS 119 472-3 section 4.2.3, and verify the authenticity of the registration certificate. b) If no registration certificate is present, query the responsible Registrar for the registered value of ``entitlement``, using the URI in the Credential Issuer Metadata, if possible. c) If querying the Registrar is not possible, optionally inspect the ``entitlement`` member included in the Credential Issuer Metadata itself per ETSI TS 119 472-3 section 4.2.3. If this procedure does not confirm that the Attestation Provider is indeed registered as a QEAA Provider, PuB-EAA Provider, or EAA Provider, the Wallet Unit SHALL display a warning to the User, and SHALL NOT request the issuance of an attestation.<br><br> *Note: The information in the ``entitlement`` member included in the Credential Issuer Metadata (3rd option above) is self-declared by the Attestation Provider. It is up to the Wallet Provider to decide to trust this information if the registration certificate is not available and querying the registry is not successful.* | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 10 | Registration Certificate, Registry | Trust evaluation (Authorization) | Wallet Provider | Yes | Equivalent to ISSU_24a |
| ISSU_34b | Before requesting the issuance of an attestation, the Wallet Unit SHALL verify whether the Provider properly registered for the issuance of the type of attestation that the User wants to obtain. To do so, the Wallet Unit SHALL a) Inspect the ``providesAttestations`` member in the registration certificate of the Attestation Provider, if provided in the Credential Issuer Metadata per ETSI TS 119 472-3 section 4.2.3, and verify the authenticity of the registration certificate. b) If no registration certificate is present, query the responsible Registrar for the registered value of ``providesAttestations``, using the URI in the Credential Issuer Metadata, if possible. c) If querying the Registrar is not possible, optionally inspect the ``providesAttestations`` member included in the Credential Issuer Metadata itself per ETSI TS 119 472-3 section 4.2.3. If this procedure does not confirm that the Attestation Provider registered for the relevant type of attestation, the Wallet Unit SHALL display a warning to the User, and SHALL NOT request the issuance of an attestation.<br><br> *Note: The information in the ``providesAttestation`` member included in the Credential Issuer Metadata (3rd option above) is self-declared by the Attestation Provider.

| OIA_12 | For both proximity and remote presentation flows, a Relying Party SHALL validate the signature of a PID using a trust anchor provided in a PID Provider LoTE made available in accordance with [Topic 31]. | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 1 | Trusted List | Trust evaluation (Authentication) | Relying Party | Yes |  |
| OIA_13 | For both proximity and remote presentation flows, a Relying Party SHALL validate the qualified signature of a QEAA in accordance with Art.32 of the [European Digital Identity Regulation]. For the verification, the Relying Party SHALL use a trust anchor provided in a QEAA Provider Trusted List made available in accordance with Art. 22 of the [European Digital Identity Regulation]. | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 1 | Trusted List | Trust evaluation (Authentication) | Relying Party | Yes |  |
| OIA_14 | For both proximity and remote presentation flows, a Relying Party SHALL validate the qualified signature of a PuB-EAA in accordance with Art.32 of the [European Digital Identity Regulation]. For that verification, the Relying Party SHALL use the public key provided in the qualified certificate of the QTSP supporting the qualified signature. The Relying Party SHALL also validate the qualified certificate of the QTSP using a trust anchor provided in a Trusted List made available in accordance with Art. 22 of the [European Digital Identity Regulation]. The Relying Party SHALL also verify the certified attributes of the qualified certificate, as specified in Article 45f. | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 1 | Trusted List | Trust evaluation (Authentication) | Relying Party | Yes |  |
| OIA_15 | For both proximity and remote presentation flows, a Relying Party SHALL validate the signature of a non-qualified EAA using a trust anchor provided according to the mechanism(s) specified in the applicable Rulebook, see [Topic 12]. <br> <br>*Note: <br>a) OIA_12 - OIA_15 imply that a Relying Party Instance must know if the attestation it is requesting from a Wallet Instance is a PID, a QEAA, a PuB-EAA, or a non-qualified EAA. These requirements also imply that the Relying Party Instance must store trust anchors in such a way that, at the time of verification, it is able to distinguish between trust anchors usable either for PIDs, for QEAAs, for PuB-EAAs, or for non-qualified EAAs. <br> b) PID Providers, QEAA Providers, and PuB-EAA Providers are trusted by other actors in the EUDI Wallet ecosystem to not fraudulently issue attestations (or PIDs) that they are not legally allowed to issue. This trust is warranted since these kinds of providers operate within a regulated framework and are regularly audited. However, non-qualified EAA Providers are unregulated and may not be completely trustworthy. Therefore, when it receives an non-qualified attestation, a Relying Party Instance may have to verify that the non-qualified EAA Provider is authorised or registered to issue this type of attestation, in addition to verifying the signature over the attestation using the EAA Provider's trust anchor. Mechanisms allowing to do this should be defined in the applicable Rulebook, see ARB_26.* | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 1 | Trusted List | Trust evaluation (Authentication) | Relying Party | Yes |  |
| GenNot_01 | Member States SHALL notify all PID Providers, PuB-EAA Providers, Wallet Providers, Access Certificate Authorities, and Providers of registration certificates to the European Commission, according all relevant requirements in Technical Specification 2. | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 31 | Technical Specifications | Notification | Member State, Trusted List Provider | No | EC standardization responsibility.

| GenNot_05 | As part of the specifications referred to in GenNot_01, the European Commission SHALL establish standard operating procedures for the suspension or cancellation of a PID Provider, PuB-EAA Provider, Wallet Provider, Access Certificate Authority, or Provider of registration certificates. These operating procedures SHALL include unambiguous conditions for suspension or cancellation. As an outcome of the suspension or cancellation procedure, the status of the suspended or cancelled PID Provider, PuB-EAA Provider, Wallet Provider, Access Certificate Authority or Provider of registration certificates in the respective LoTE or Trusted List SHALL be changed to Invalid. | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 31 | Technical Specifications | Entity Lifecycle Management | European Commission, Trusted List Provider | Yes | EC standardization responsibility. To be tested: the TL Provider updates to invalid the state of the suspended/cancelled entities. |
| PPNot_01 | The European Commission SHALL establish technical specifications for the common set of information to be notified about PID Providers. | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 31 | Technical Specifications | Notification | European Commission | No | EC standardization responsibility |
| PPNot_02 | The common set of information to be notified about a PID Provider SHALL include at least: 1. Identification data: i. MS/Country of establishment, ii. Name as registered in an official record, iii. Where applicable: a. A business registration number from an official record, b. Identification data from that official record. 2. PID Provider trust anchors, i.e., public keys and name as per point 1) ii) above, supporting the authentication of PIDs issued by the PID Provider, 3. Trust anchors of Access Certificate Authorities for PID Providers, i.e., public keys and CA name, supporting the authentication of the PID Provider by Wallet Units at the service supply point(s) listed per point 4. below. 4. Service supply point(s), i.e., the URL(s) at which a Wallet Unit can start the process of requesting and obtaining a PID. <br> <br>*Note: <br> a) Relating to point 3. above: PID Provider Access Certificate Authority trust anchors are notified separately from the Access Certificate Authority for Relying Parties (see Section G below), since PID Providers are -legally speaking- not Relying Parties. <br> b) For the concept of an Access Certificate Authority, see also [Topic 27] and Section 6.3.2 of the ARF main document.* | ARF 2.8.0 Annex 2 - Topic 31 | Trusted List | Notification | European Commission | No | EC standardization responsibility |
