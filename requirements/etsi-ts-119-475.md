# Normative Requirements (from ETSI TS 119 475 V1.1.1)

The following requirements are taken from ETSI 119 475 v1.1.1. A requirement is in scope for the Pilot if it:

- is needed for at least one of the Aptitude use cases;
- is needed for the Authentication, Authorization, and/or Lifecycle Management process;
- does not involve an external entity such as a Member State or the European Commission (for policy specification or additional technical specifications).

It is the authority trusted by users (subscribers and relying parties).<br>- CA (Certification Authority): The technical component specifically responsible for issuing certificates.<br>Rmk: A TSP may use an internal CA or an external one<br>2. Subscriber and Subject<br>- Subject: The entity identified inside the certificate (whose public key is certified). It can be a natural person, a legal person, a device or system (e.g., a web server or router).<br>- Subscriber: The entity that contracts with the TSP to request the certificate<br>Rmk: subscriber and subject may not be the same entity | ETSI TS 119 475 V1.1.1 | Registration certificate | Registration | Provider of Registration Certificates, EAA Provider, QEAA Provider, PuB-EAA Provider, PID Provider, Relying Party | No | This prescribes some general requirements about the CA, i.e., the TSP component which issues RC and substriber vs subject of the certificate (i.e., who request the RC vs whose the RC is about). <br>We can assume that no pki hierarchy is in place and thus the TSP issues certificates directly for the pilot and that subsriber and subject are the same entity. |
| OVR-6.1.4-02 | The WRPRC provider shall include a clear description of the public key infrastructure hierarchy and certification paths from the end-entity wallet-relying party registration certificates up to the top of the hierarchy used for issuing them, while indicating the expected trust anchor(s) in such hierarchy and paths.  | ETSI TS 119 475 V1.1.1 | Registration certificate | Registration |  | Maybe | These are audited at MS level, a mock-up version could be prepared for piloting |

| REG-6.2.2.1-01 |  The naming requirements identified in GEN-5.1.1-01 -- GEN-5.2.4-09 shall apply.  | ETSI TS 119 475 V1.1.1 | Registration certificate | Registration |  | Yes |  |

| REG-6.2.2.2-05 | If the request for certificate is provided directly by the wallet-relying registrar the WRPRC provider may rely on the identity proofing of wallet-relying party provided by the wallet-relying registrar.  | ETSI TS 119 475 V1.1.1 | Registration certificate | Registration | Registrar, Provider of Registration Certificates | No | TBD which is the relationship between the registrar and WRPRC provider |
| REG-6.2.2.2-06 | The WRPRC provider may provide identity proofing and identity proofs for the wallet-relying party registrar for the purpose of registration. | ETSI TS 119 475 V1.1.1 | Registration certificate | Registration |  | No | Policy at MS level |
