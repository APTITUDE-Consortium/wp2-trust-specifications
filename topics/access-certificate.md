# Access Certificate

This section describes the purpose, format and content of wallet-relying party access certificates.

According to the CIR (EU) 2025/848, a wallet-relying party access certificate (access certificate), is a certificate for electronic seals or signatures authenticating and validating the wallet-relying party.
Issued by a designated provider under Member State supervision, the access certificate serves to authenticate and verify the trustworthiness of the wallet-relying parties when they interact with the EUDI wallet.
The suspension or cancellation of the relying party services, involves revocation of all valid access certificates by the relevant issuing authority, such that the relying party is no longer able to interact with wallet units.

To guarantee interoperability of those certificates across all the wallets provided within the Union, wallet-relying party access certificates should adhere to common requirements, with regards to their content and format in accordance with the table below and the following standards, specifications and regulation:
